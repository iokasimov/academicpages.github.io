Before we continue, let's define some type annotations that will be used in this article:
```haskell
type (:=) t a = t a -- | Functor's object
type (:.) t u a = t (u a) -- | Composition of functors
type (~>) t u = forall a . t a -> u a -- | Natural transformation
```

In Haskell we get used to work with effects as functors, whose objects (arguments) are some expressions, wich we are interesting in some particular moment.
When we see type annotation like `Maybe a`, we abstract from existing of this `a`, focusing all our attention on this `a` like it always exists. The same story with `List a` - multiple `a` values, `State s a` - `a`, which depends from some current state, `Either e a` - some `a` that can throw an error `e`. For example: `List :. Maybe := a` - such expression is easy to imagine, this is a list of values, whose existing is unknown.

The most obvious way to cover some expression with more than one effect is to wrap one into another - this is a functors composition. Effects in usual compositions have no way to affect each other (if you don't use `Traversable` methods). To merge several effects into one we use transformers.

So, what are the pros and cons of these both methods?

Compositions:
* There is no need in additional datatypes
* There is no generalised method for merging effects
* Everything is composable, as long as you don't need monadic behaviour

Transformers:
* They let you merge several effects into one
* With `lift` you can do computations on any level of monad transformer stack
* But it needs to have additional datatype (usually, newtype) (like `ReaderT`, `StateT`, `ExceptT`, `MaybeT`)
* You cannot consider effects alone, but there are special functions for that (like `mapReaderT`, `mapStateT`, `mapExceptT`, `mapMaybeT`)

Transformers differ from compositions that they have this "joint machinery". If you have some composition, you can convert it to transformer and vice versa - we need joint schemes for that. If we take a closer look on types for monad transformers from Kmett's transformers library, we can see some patterns:
```haskell
newtype ReaderT r m a = ReaderT { runReaderT :: r -> m a }
newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) }
newtype ExceptT e m a = ExceptT { runExceptT :: m (Either e a)) }
newtype StateT s m a = StateT { runStateT :: s -> m (a,s) }
```

Transformers describe special case of how two effects - determined and undetermined should be juncted. We will try to rewrite type definitions above in terms of determined and undetermined effects:

```haskell
Reader: r -> u a ===> (->) r :. u := a ===> t :. u := a (t ~ (->) r)
Maybe: u (Maybe a) ===> u :. Maybe := a ===> u :. t := a (t ~ Maybe)
Either: u (Either e a) ===> u :. Either e := a ===> u :. t := a (t ~ Either e)
```

Some effects are pretty complicated and can be defined via composition of more simpler effects:

```haskell
State: s -> m (a, s) ===> (->) s :. (,) s := a ==> t :. u :. t’ := a
newtype State s a = State ((->) s :. (,) s := a)
```

If we take a closer look again on first three examples, we can consider some patterns: in `Reader`, determined effect wraps undetermined one; but in case of `Either` and `Maybe` we do the opposite thing - undetermined effects wrap determined. In case of `State` we put undetermined effect between two determined effects.

Let's try to express those patterns in types:

```haskell
newtype TU t u a = TU (t :. u := a)
newtype UT t u a = UT (u :. t := a)
newtype TUT t u t' a = TUT (t :. u :. t' := a)
```
We just defined joint schemes - they are functors compositions in wrappers, that can point on the positions of determined and undetermined effects. In the essence, methods of transformers, which names start with `run` unwrap these wrappers and return functors composition. We can generalise this operation:

```haskell
class Composition t where
	type Primary t a :: *
	run :: t a -> Primary t a
```

Now we have a generalised way to run these schemes:

```haskell
instance Composition (TU t u) where
	type Primary (TU t u) a = t :. u := a
	run (TU x) = x

instance Composition (UT t u) where
	type Primary (UT t u) a = u :. t := a
	run (UT x) = x

instance Composition (TUT t u t') where
	type Primary (TUT t u t') a = t :. u :. t' := a
	run (TUT x) = x
```

But what about transformers? We need to define new typeclass again. It consist of:
* Some corresponding joint scheme that uniquely defined for this type
* `embed` method to lift undetermined effect up to transformer layer
* `build` method to make determined effect a transformer

```haskell
class Composition t => Transformer t where
	type Schema (t :: * -> *) (u :: * -> *) = (r :: * -> *) | r -> t u
	embed :: Functor u => u ~> Schema t u
	build :: Applicative u => t ~> Schema t u

type (:>) t u a = Transformer t => Schema t u a
```

All we need is to define instances, let's start with `Maybe` and `Either`:

```haskell
instance Transformer Maybe where
	type Schema Maybe u = UT Maybe u
	embed x = UT $ Just <$> x
	build x = UT . pure $ x

instance Transformer (Either e) where
	type Schema (Either e) u = UT (Either e) u
	embed x = UT $ Right <$> x
	build x = UT . pure $ x
```

We will create our own type for `Reader` because we don't have it in base. And we need to define `Composition` instance for `Reader` just because it can be expressed via more simpler effect (a function arrow).

```haskell
newtype Reader e a = Reader (e -> a)

instance Composition (Reader e) where
	type Primary (Reader e) a = (->) e a
	run (Reader x) = x

instance Transformer (Reader e) where
	type Schema (Reader e) u = TU ((->) e) u
	embed x = TU . const $ x
	build x = TU $ pure <$> run x
```

Let's do the same with `State`:

```haskell
newtype State s a = State ((->) s :. (,) s := a)

instance Composition (State s) where
	type Primary (State s) a = (->) s :. (,) s := a
	run (State x) = x

instance Transformer (State s) where
	type Schema (State s) u = TUT ((->) s) u ((,) s)
	embed x = TUT $ \s -> (s,) <$> x
	build x = TUT $ pure <$> run x
```

Let's try our approach on the real world tasks - we'll write a program that can test correctness of location of various styles of brackets in a source code. First, we need to define types for brackets: they can be opened and closed; they can have different styles.

```haskell
data Shape = Opened | Closed

data Style = Round | Square | Angle | Curly
```

Our program is indifferent to other symbols:

```haskell
data Symbol = Nevermind | Bracket Style Shape
```

Also, we're going to define what types of errors our program can stumble on:

```haskell
data Stumble
	= Deadend (Int, Style) -- Closed bracket without opened one
	| Logjam (Int, Style)  -- Opened bracket without closed one
	| Mismatch (Int, Style) (Int, Style)  -- Стиль закрытой скобки не соответствует открытой
```

What are the effects our program needs? We have to store a stack of styles of open brackets which should be checked later and we should stop all computation on first error. Let's build a transformer:

```haskell
State [(Int, Style)] :> Either Stumble := ()
```

This algorithm is easy: we traverse the structure of indexed brackets, if we haven't stumbled on error and we have some brackets left in the stack - it means that the opened bracket doesn't have the closed one.

```haskell
checking :: Traversable t => t (Int, Symbol) -> Either Stumble ()
checking struct = run (traverse proceed struct) [] >>= \case
	(s : _, _) -> Left . Logjam $ s where
	([], _) -> Right ()
```

We put to the stack each opened bracket, and any closed one we match with the last opened one:

```haskell
proceed :: (Int, Symbol) -> State [(Int, Style)] :> Either Stumble := ()
proceed (_, Nevermind) = pure ()
proceed (n, Bracket style Opened) = build . modify . (:) $ (n, style)
-- любую закрытую скобку сравниваем с последней запомнившейся открытой
proceed (n, Bracket closed Closed) = build get >>= \case
	[]-> embed $ Left . Deadend $ (n, closed)
	((m, opened) : ss) -> if closed /= opened
		then embed . Left $ Mismatch (m, opened) (n, closed)
		else build $ put ss
```

If we have some functors composition we can convert it to transformer and vice versa. Suddenly, that trick doesn't work with mother of monads - continuations. Just because we cannot redefine it via functors composition.
